- name: Natural Language Processing
  i18n: name
  gh_user: RaRe-Technologies
  repo: gensim
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/gensim.png
  desc: I have contributed to one of the most popular Python open source packages in Topic Modeling called <a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/">Gensim</a>. My work included features that made it into a subsequent release, fixing bugs, and improving the documentation of complex model implementations. Here is <a href="">my fork</a>


- name: Machine Learning & Collaboration
  i18n: name
  gh_user: MLblog
  repo: jads_kaggle
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/kaggle.png
  desc: I initiated and contributed to a team of colleagues participating in multiple machine learning competitions. I mentored team members in modern software engineering practices including object oriented programming and version control, by delivering on-site workshops, writing comprehensive guides and conducting code reviews. 

- name: Functional Programming in Scala Specialization 
  i18n: name
  url: https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/BWLQC563PW4R
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/coursera.png
  desc: Succesfully completed a series of four courses, as well as a capstone project in order to learn Scala and Spark, as well as the Functional Programming Paradigm. My capstone project was an application able to process and visualize large-scale temperature datasets. The source code is not published in accordance to <a href="https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863-Coursera-Honor-Code">coursera's honor code</a>.


- name: Robotics Simulation
  i18n: name
  gh_user: stdr-simulator-ros-pkg
  repo: stdr_simulator
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/stdr.png
  desc: Integrated a new GUI into a robotics application written in C++. I also implemented several design and performance optimizations, one of which prevented a <a href="https://github.com/stdr-simulator-ros-pkg/stdr_simulator/pull/186">potential memory leak</a>. The project is currently distributed as an official ROS package.

- name: Digit Recognition
  i18n: name
  gh_user: steremma
  repo: digitRecognition
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/mnist.png
  desc: As a BSc. student, I designed and implemented a neural network able to label hand-written digits along with a friend. The application was developed in vanilla C++ and parallelized in CUDA in 2013, when deep learning frameworks were not as popular as they are today (most of them did not even exist).
