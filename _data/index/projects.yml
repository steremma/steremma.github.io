- name: A scalable Grid Computing framework for extensible phylogenetic profile construction
  i18n: name
  url: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307585591_A_Scalable_Grid_Computing_Framework_for_Extensible_Phylogenetic_Profile_Construction
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/springerLink.png
  desc: Published by SpringerLink, this paper presents my design and implementation of a distributed framework that can exploit Grid infrastructure resources (EGI) to scale-up common genomics workflows. Achieved a 30x speed-up compared to serial implementations.

- name: GPU accerelated Convolutional Neural Networks 
  i18n: name
  url: https://gist.github.com/steremma/048549de16cc48610233c943ecf495b4
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/google.png
  desc: Designed and implemented a fully functional Convolutional Neural Network library in CUDA, allowing the timely processing of particle physics experimental data. My implementation consistently outperforms the previous CPU version by a factor of 3, as its performance and memory footprint is comparable to those of Keras.

- name: Natural Language Processing
  i18n: name
  repo: steremma/gensim
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/gensim.png
  desc: I have contributed to one of the most popular Python open source packages in Topic Modeling called Gensim. My work includes adding features that made it into a subsequent release, fixing bugs, and improving the documentation of complex model implementations.

- name: Robotics Simulation
  i18n: name
  repo: steremma/stdr_simulator
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/stdr.png
  desc: Integrated a new GUI into a robotics application written in C++ and implemented several design and performance optimizations. The project is currently distributed as an official ROS package.
